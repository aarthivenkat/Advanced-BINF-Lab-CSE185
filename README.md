# Advanced Bioinformatics Lab
### Taught by Dr. Melissa Gymrek

This course emphasizes the hands-on application of bioinformatics to biological problems. Students will gain experience in the application of existing software, as well as in combining approaches to answer specific biological questions. Sequence alignment, fast database search, comparative genomics, expression analysis, computational proteomics, genome-wide association studies, next generation sequencing, genomics and big data. The course ends with students devising and completing their own bioinformatics project, expounding on their findings in a final report.
